# Implementation Plan - Environment Synchronization

We will synchronize the Antigravity environment settings and Agent "Brain" (Tasks/Chat History) between computers using Google Drive.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Google Drive Location**: I could not automatically locate your Google Drive folder. Please provide the absolute path (e.g., `G:\My Drive` or `C:\Users\Gustavo\Google Drive`).
> **Sync Method**: Since native "Settings Sync" is not active, we will use a file-based approach (Symlinks) to keep [settings.json](file:///C:/Users/Gustavo/AppData/Roaming/Antigravity/User/settings.json) and your "Brain" in sync.

## Proposed Changes

### Settings Optimization
We will create a standardized [settings.json](file:///C:/Users/Gustavo/AppData/Roaming/Antigravity/User/settings.json) optimized for synchronization.

#### [MODIFY] [settings.json](file:///C:/Users/Gustavo/AppData/Roaming/Antigravity/User/settings.json)
- **Visual Customization**: Add distinct title bar colors to identify the machine.
- **Editor Consistency**:
    - `files.autoSave`: `afterDelay`
    - `editor.formatOnSave`: `true`
    - `editor.tabSize`: 4
    - `files.trimTrailingWhitespace`: `true`
- **Sync Preparation**: Ensure paths in settings are relative or use environment variables where possible.

### Data Synchronization (The "Brain")
We will link the local "Brain" directory to Google Drive.

#### [NEW] Symlink Creation Script (PowerShell)
- **Goal**: Redirect `C:\Users\Gustavo\.gemini\antigravity\brain` to `[Your Google Drive Path]\Antigravity\brain`.
- **Steps**:
    1.  Check if `[Drive Path]\Antigravity\brain` exists.
    2.  If yes, back up local brain and create symlink to Drive.
    3.  If no, move local brain to Drive and create symlink back.

### Persistence & Extensions
- **Recommendation**: Install **"Project Manager"** extension.
    - *Why*: It saves your projects (folders/workspaces) in a `projects.json` file which can also be synced via the same method.
- **Alternative**: Use a portable `data` directory approach if Antigravity supports it (advanced).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Check Symlink**: Verify that creating a file in `.gemini\antigravity\brain` instantly appears in the Google Drive folder.
2.  **Check Settings**: Restart Antigravity and confirm the new settings (e.g., color theme) are applied.
3.  **Cross-Device Check**: (User Action) On your second PC, you will need to point its brain folder to the same Google Drive location.
