# Implementation Plan - Environment Synchronization

We will synchronize Antigravity with "Drive on the Web" as requested.
Since the user wants a "Web" link and we are missing a local Drive folder, the best approach is to instal **Google Drive for Desktop (Streaming Mode)**. This "links" the PC to the web without downloading everything, creating a virtual G: drive that we can then use for our "Brain" sync.

For settings, we investigated [userDataSync.log](file:///C:/Users/Gustavo/AppData/Roaming/Antigravity/logs/20260216T180632/userDataSync.log) and found activity. We will optimize [settings.json](file:///C:/Users/Gustavo/AppData/Roaming/Antigravity/User/settings.json) and ensure it's being captured.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> **"Link to Web" Strategy**: Truly linking local files to the web requires a bridge. **Google Drive for Desktop** in *Stream files* mode is the perfect solution. It mounts your cloud storage as a virtual drive (G:), allowing instant sync without using up local disk space.
> **Settings Sync**: I found logs indicating the built-in Sync is active. I will inspect them to confirm what is being backed up.

## Proposed Changes

### Settings Optimization
We will create a standardized [settings.json](file:///C:/Users/Gustavo/AppData/Roaming/Antigravity/User/settings.json) optimized for synchronization.

#### [MODIFY] [settings.json](file:///C:/Users/Gustavo/AppData/Roaming/Antigravity/User/settings.json)
- **Visual Customization**: Add distinct title bar colors to identify the machine.
- **Editor Consistency**:
    - `files.autoSave`: `afterDelay`
    - `editor.formatOnSave`: `true`
    - `editor.tabSize`: 4
    - `files.trimTrailingWhitespace`: `true`
- **Sync Preparation**: Ensure paths in settings are relative or use environment variables where possible.

### Data Synchronization (The "Brain")
We will link the local "Brain" directory to Google Drive.

#### [NEW] Symlink Creation (Once Drive is Linked)
- **Prerequisite**: Google Drive for Desktop installed and running (G: drive active).
- **Action**: Create Symlink `C:\Users\Gustavo\.gemini\antigravity\brain` <-> `G:\My Drive\Antigravity\brain`.

### Application State
- I found **`unchase.antigravity-storage-manager`** extension installed.
    - Check if this is being used to sync to a cloud provider? (Likely local/network storage).
    - Recommendation: Stick to the Brain-to-Drive symlink for simplicity and robustness.

### Persistence & Extensions
- **Recommendation**: Install **"Project Manager"** extension.
    - *Why*: It saves your projects (folders/workspaces) in a `projects.json` file which can also be synced via the same method.
- **Alternative**: Use a portable `data` directory approach if Antigravity supports it (advanced).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Check Symlink**: Verify that creating a file in `.gemini\antigravity\brain` instantly appears in the Google Drive folder.
2.  **Check Settings**: Restart Antigravity and confirm the new settings (e.g., color theme) are applied.
3.  **Cross-Device Check**: (User Action) On your second PC, you will need to point its brain folder to the same Google Drive location.
