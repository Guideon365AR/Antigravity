# Implementation Plan - Environment Synchronization

We will synchronize the Antigravity environment settings and Agent "Brain" (Tasks/Chat History) between computers using Google Drive.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Google Drive Location**: I need to confirm the exact location of your Google Drive folder to create the symbolic links. I will attempt to locate it, but if I cannot, I will ask for the path.
> **Symlink Creation**: Creating symbolic links requires knowing the target destination in your cloud storage.

## Proposed Changes

### Settings Optimization
We will update [settings.json](file:///C:/Users/Gustavo/AppData/Roaming/Antigravity/User/settings.json) to include standard settings for synchronization and a consistent interface.

#### [MODIFY] [settings.json](file:///C:/Users/Gustavo/AppData/Roaming/Antigravity/User/settings.json)
- Add distinct visual customizations (title bar color) to identify the machine.
- Enable `files.autoSave`.
- Configure basic editor settings (font, tab size) for consistency.

### Data Synchronization (The "Brain")
We will link the local "Brain" directory to Google Drive.

#### [NEW] Symlink Creation Script
- A PowerShell script to:
    1. Backup existing `brain` folder.
    2. Move `brain` content to Google Drive (if not already there) or rename local folder.
    3. Create a Symlink `C:\Users\Gustavo\.gemini\antigravity\brain` -> `[Google Drive Path]\Antigravity\brain`.

### Application State & Extensions
- Recommendation: Use the "Project Manager" extension for persistent project states.
- Suggest "Settings Sync" (if available) or manual file backup of `settings.json` to Drive.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Settings**: Open Antigravity on the second machine (once synced) and verify the theme/settings match.
- **Data**:
    1. Create a dummy task/file in the `brain` folder on this machine.
    2. Verify it appears in the Google Drive folder.
    3. (User action) Verify it appears on the second machine's `brain` folder.
